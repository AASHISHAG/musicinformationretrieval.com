      "Purpose: Introduce you to the practice of analyzing, segmenting, feature extracting, and applying basic classifications to audio files.  Our future labs will build upon this essential work - but will use more sophisticated training sets, features, and classifiers. \n",

      "3.  Set the \"Java Heap Memory\" to 900 MB via : File > Preferences > General > Java Heap Memory.\n",

      "    One of Matlab's greatest features is its rich and easy visualization functions.  Visualizing your data at every possible step in the algorithm development process not only builds a practical understanding of the variables, parameters and results, but it greatly aids debugging. \n",
