      "Section 2: Spectral Features & k-NN\n",
      "------------------------------------\n",
      "\n",
      "My first audio classifier: introducing K-NN!  We can now appreciate why we need additional intelligence in our systems - heuristics can't very far in the world of complex audio signals.  We'll be using Netlab's implementation of the k-NN for our work here.  It proves be a straight-forward and easy to use implementation.  The steps and skills of working with one classifier will scale nicely to working with other, more complex classifiers. \n",
      "\n",
      "We're also going to be using the new features in our arsenal: cherishing those \"spectral moments\" (centroid, bandwidth, skewness, kurtosis) and also examining other spectral statistics. \n",
      " \n",
      "### TRAINING DATA\n",
      "\n",
      "First off, we want to analyze and feature extract a small collection of audio samples - storing their feature data as our \"training data\".  The below commands read all of the .wav files in a directory into a structure, snareFileList.  \n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Use these commands to read in a list of filenames (samples) in a directory, replacing the path with the actual directory that the audio \\ drum samples are stored in.\n",
      "\n",
      "        snareDirectory = ['/usr/ccrma/courses/mir2013/audio/drum samples/snares/'];\n",
      "        snareFileList = getFileNames(snareDirectory ,'wav')\n",
      "\n",
      "        kickDirectory = ['/usr/ccrma/courses/mir2013/audio/drum samples/kicks/'];\n",
      "        kickFileList = getFileNames(kickDirectory ,'wav')\n",
      "\n",
      "2.  To access the filenames contained in the cell array, use the brackets { }  to get to the element that you want to access. \n",
      "\n",
      "    For example, to access the text file name of the 1st file in the list, you would type:\n",
      "\n",
      "        snareFileList{1}\n",
      "\n",
      "    When we feature extract a sample collection, we need to sequentially access audio files, segment them (or not), and feature extract them.  Loading a lot of audio files into memory is not always a feasible or desirable operation, so you will create a loop which loads an audio file, feature extracts it, and closes  the audio file.  Note that the only information that we retain in memory are the features that are extracted.\n",
      "\n",
      "3.  Create a loop which reads in an audio file, extracts the zero crossing rate, and some spectral statistics.  The feature information for each audio file (the \"feature vector\") should be stored as a feature array, with columns being the features and rows for each file. \n",
      " \n",

      "### Building Models\n",
      "\n",
      "1.  Examine the feature array for the various snare samples.  What do you notice? \n",
      "\n",
      "2.  Since the features are different scales, we will want to normalize each feature vector to a common range - storing the scaling coefficients for later use.  Many techniques exist for scaling your features.  We'll use linear scaling, which forces the features into the range -1 to 1.\n",
      "\n",
      "    For this, we'll use a custom-created function called scale.  Scale returns an array of scaled values, as well as the multiplication and subtraction values which were used to conform each column into -1 to 1.  Use this function in your code. \n",
